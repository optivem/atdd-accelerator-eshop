# System Behavior (Architecture)

## Architecture Style

- Monolith (MVC App)

Note: I've chosen a Monolith for purposes of this course, because Acceptance Tests are insensitive to architecture choice. So the choice of architecture is irrelevant, for the purposes of this course. However, in your case, for better translatability to your Real Life Project, I recommend choosing the Architecture Style reflects your Real Life Project. But if you're limited with time, then go with a Monolith, and you can change your Architecture Style later, it shouldn't affect your Acceptance Tests.
